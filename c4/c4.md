### Slide 1: Title & Introduction (5 minutes)
- **Title:** “Unsupervised Learning – Clustering Techniques”
- **Subtitle:** Course 4 of the Unsupervised Learning Series
- **Objectives:**
  - Understand the basics of clustering.
  - Familiarize with K-means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering.
  - Know how to evaluate clustering results.
  - Explore applications: anomaly detection, customer segmentation, image compression.

---

### Slide 2: Overview of Unsupervised Learning (5 minutes)
- **Definition:** Learning patterns from unlabeled data.
- **Key Idea:** Finds hidden structure without explicit labels.
- **Common Techniques:** Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.
- **Main Focus:** Clustering methods and applications.

---

### Slide 3: What is Clustering? (5 minutes)
- **Conceptual Definition:** Grouping data points based on similarity.
- **Goal:** Maximize intra-cluster similarity & minimize inter-cluster similarity.
- **Usage Scenarios:** Data exploration, preliminary analysis, market segmentation.

---

### Slide 4: K-Means Clustering – Concepts (10 minutes)
- **Basic Steps:**
  1. Choose number of clusters \( k \).
  2. Initialize cluster centroids.
  3. Assign points to nearest centroid.
  4. Recalculate centroids.
  5. Repeat until convergence.
- **Strengths:** Simple, efficient for large datasets.
- **Weaknesses:** Must specify \( k \), sensitive to outliers, works best with spherical clusters.

---

### Slide 5: K-Means Example (5 minutes)
- **Illustrate the Process:**
  - Show initial random centroids.
  - Data point assignment.
  - Update centroids iteratively.
- **[An example illustrating K-means clustering in a dataset of customer purchase history]**

---

### Slide 5.1 (5 minutes): The Elbow Method for K-Means
- **Motivation:** How to choose the optimal number of clusters \(k\).
- **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS or inertia):**
  - Plots WCSS against \(k\).
  - Look for the “elbow” where the curve levels off significantly.
- **Practical Tips:**
  - The elbow might not always be clear.
  - Combine with silhouette scores or domain knowledge for a more robust decision.
- **[An example demonstrating the elbow plot with different \(k\) values]**

---

### Slide 6: DBSCAN – Concepts (10 minutes)
- **Acronym:** Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
- **Key Parameters:**
  - \( \varepsilon \) (epsilon) – neighborhood radius
  - \( \text{minPts} \) – minimum points required to form a dense region
- **Benefits:**
  - Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.
  - Identifies outliers as noise.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Parameter selection can be tricky.
  - Not suitable for very high-dimensional data.
---

### Slide 7: DBSCAN Example (5 minutes)
- **Demonstrate Density-Based Formation:**
  - Points in high-density areas become core points.
  - Points in the neighborhood of core points become part of the cluster.
  - Outliers remain unassigned.
- **[An example showing DBSCAN separating dense clusters and labeling sparse points as outliers]**
- **[Article](https://builtin.com/articles/dbscan#:~:text=What%20Is%20DBSCAN%3F-,Density%2Dbased%20spatial%20clustering%20of%20applications%20with%20noise%20(DBSCAN),data%20cleaning%20and%20outlier%20detection.)**
---

### Slide 8: Agglomerative Clustering – Concepts (10 minutes)
- **Hierarchical Approach:**
  - Start with each point as its own cluster.
  - Iteratively merge the closest clusters.
  - Continues until all points form a single cluster or a stopping criterion is reached.
- **Linkage Criteria:** Single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, etc.
- **Dendrogram:** Visual representation of the merging process.

---

### Slide 9: Agglomerative Clustering Example (5 minutes)
- **Dendrogram Interpretation:**
  - Cutting the dendrogram at different levels yields different numbers of clusters.
- **[An example illustrating how to read a dendrogram for a dataset of images grouped by visual similarity]**

---

### Slide 10: Evaluating Clustering Results (5 minutes)
- **Internal Metrics:**
  - Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, Calinski-Harabasz index.
- **External Metrics (if labels are available):**
  - Rand index, Adjusted Rand index, Purity, F-measure.
- **Practical Tips:**
  - Use multiple metrics to get a better view.
  - Visual inspection still helpful for interpretability.

---

### Slide 11: Applications – Anomaly Detection (5 minutes)
- **Clustering for Outlier Detection:**
  - Outliers are points that don’t belong to any cluster (e.g., DBSCAN).
  - K-means distance thresholds to identify anomalies.
- **[An example describing how unusual network traffic is flagged as an anomaly]**

---

### Slide 12: Applications – Customer Segmentation (5 minutes)
- **Objective:** Group customers by similarity for targeted marketing.
- **Typical Features:** Purchase history, browsing patterns, demographic data.
- **[An example illustrating how segments are used to personalize emails and offers]**

---

### Slide 13: Applications – Image Compression (5 minutes)
- **Principle:**
  - Cluster pixels into a smaller set of colors (e.g., K-means).
  - Replace each pixel with its cluster’s representative color.
- **[An example showing how a photo is compressed by reducing the color palette without major visual loss]**

---

### Slide 14: Q&A and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)
- **Recap Key Points:**
  - Three clustering methods (K-means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative).
  - Evaluating clusters (internal vs. external measures).
  - Practical use cases in anomaly detection, segmentation, compression.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Experiment with different algorithms and datasets.
  - Explore advanced clustering techniques (spectral clustering, etc.).
