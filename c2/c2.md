### Slide 1: Title & Overview
- **Title**: Supervised Learning – Classification
- **Course Outline**:
  - Classification problem definition
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Classification Trees
  - Overfitting & Regularization (Lasso, Ridge)
  - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision-Recall, ROC-AUC
  - Real-world Applications

---

### Slide 2: Introduction to Classification Problems
- **Definition**: Predicting a discrete label or category
- **Examples**:
  - Spam or Not Spam
  - Disease Positive or Negative
- **Why Classification?**
  - Common in medical diagnoses, email filters, fraud detection

---

### Slide 3: Key Concepts for Classification
- **Features & Labels**:
  - Features = input variables (predictors)
  - Labels = target classes
- **Training vs. Testing**:
  - Training on labeled data
  - Testing to validate performance
- **[Example: Show a small dataset with features like age, income, and a binary label indicating “purchased” or “not purchased.”]**

---

### Slide 4: Naïve Bayes Classifier
- **Core Idea**:
  - Uses Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of feature independence
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple, fast, works well with noisy data
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Independence assumption may be unrealistic in some domains
- **[Example: Classify reviews as positive or negative based on word frequency]**

---

### Slide 5: Logistic Regression
- **Concept**:
  - Models the probability that a certain class is the outcome
  - Uses the logistic (sigmoid) function
- **Interpretability**:
  - Coefficients can be examined to see feature impact
- **When to Use**:
  - Binary classification with linear decision boundary
- **[Example: Predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on demographic data]**

---

### Slide 6: Classification Trees
- **Structure**:
  - Series of decision rules based on feature values
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to visualize and interpret
- **Cons**:
  - Prone to overfitting if not pruned
- **[Example: A decision tree for classifying loan approvals based on features like income, credit score, and debt ratio]**

---

### Slide 7: Overfitting & Regularization
- **Overfitting**:
  - Model fits noise or idiosyncrasies in the training data
  - Symptoms: high training accuracy, poor generalization
- **Regularization**:
  - Penalizes large coefficients to reduce overfitting
  - Common methods: Lasso (L1), Ridge (L2)

---

### Slide 8: Lasso (L1) vs. Ridge (L2)
- **Lasso (L1)**:
  - Can drive coefficients to zero → feature selection
- **Ridge (L2)**:
  - Coefficients shrink toward zero but do not typically reach it
- **Use Cases**:
  - Lasso: prefer simpler models, fewer features
  - Ridge: want to keep all features but mitigate large swings
- **[Example: Fitting a logistic regression with L1 or L2 regularization on a dataset with many features and observing which features remain significant]**

---

### Slide 9: Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**:
  - Proportion of correctly predicted labels
  - Useful when classes are balanced
- **Precision & Recall**:
  - Precision = of predicted positives, how many are correct
  - Recall = of actual positives, how many did we catch
- **ROC & AUC**:
  - Plots true positive rate vs. false positive rate
  - AUC = Area Under the ROC Curve (measure of overall performance)
- **[Example: Show confusion matrix for a binary classification problem and calculate precision, recall, and accuracy]**

---

### Slide 10: Choosing the Right Metric
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Class Imbalance: Accuracy might be misleading
  - Cost of False Positives vs. False Negatives
  - Reporting multiple metrics for clarity
- **[Example: Class-imbalanced dataset in healthcare, where false negatives might be very costly]**

Below is an **additional slide** you can insert into your **Course 2: Supervised Learning – Classification** deck, focusing on **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning. Place it after your slides on evaluation metrics or real-world applications, as it serves as a natural progression from evaluating models to improving them.

---

### Slide 10.1: Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
- **What is Hyperparameter Tuning?**
  - The process of finding the best set of parameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) that are not directly learned during training.
  - Good hyperparameters can significantly improve model performance and generalization.
- **GridSearchCV Overview**:
  - Exhaustive search over specified parameter values.
  - Uses **cross-validation** internally:
    1. Splits data into multiple folds.
    2. Trains and validates the model for each combination of parameters.
    3. Selects the combination that yields the best average performance.
- **Example**:
  - [Example: Show how tuning `max_depth` for a Decision Tree (from 2 to 10) can find an optimal depth that balances underfitting and overfitting.]

---

### Slide 11: Real-World Applications
- **Text Classification**:
  - Spam detection, sentiment analysis
- **Medical Diagnosis**:
  - Disease classification, risk assessment
- **Financial**:
  - Credit scoring, fraud detection
- **[Example: Outline how a bank uses logistic regression to identify potential fraudulent transactions]**
