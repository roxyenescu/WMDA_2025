### **Course 3: Supervised Learning – Regression**
## Slide 1: Title & Overview (~2 minutes)
- **Title**: “Supervised Learning – Regression”
- **Subtitle**: Course 3 in the Machine Learning Series
- **Objectives**:
  - Understand the concept of regression
  - Explore various regression models (Linear, Polynomial, and Trees)
  - Learn about overfitting and regularization techniques
  - Introduce evaluation metrics (R², MSE, MAE)
  - Discuss real-world use cases

---

## Slide 2: Introduction to Regression (~5 minutes)
- **What is Regression?**
  - Predicting a continuous numeric value based on input variables
  - Contrast with classification (discrete outputs)
- **Real-World Uses**:
  - Forecasting sales
  - Predicting house prices
  - Estimating production costs
- **Example**: [Show a short scenario about predicting housing prices based on square footage, location, etc.]

---

## Slide 3: Linear Regression Basics (~10 minutes)
- **Concept**:
  - Model form: \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n \)
  - Assumes a linear relationship between predictors and target
- **Key Terminologies**:
  - Coefficients (weights)
  - Intercept
  - Residuals (errors)
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**:
  - Minimizes the sum of squared residuals
- **Example**: [Simple dataset with one feature (e.g., hours studied) and one target (exam score), illustrating best fit line]

---

## Slide 4: Polynomial Regression (~8 minutes)
- **When Linear Isn’t Enough**:
  - Relationship between variables might be non-linear
- **Model Form**:
  - Introduce polynomial terms (e.g., \(x^2, x^3\)) for better fit
- **Caution**:
  - Higher-degree polynomials can overfit
- **Example**: [Scatter plot of a curved relationship (e.g., car’s speed vs. braking distance), demonstrating a polynomial fit]

---

## Slide 5: Regression Trees (~8 minutes)
- **Concept of Decision Trees**:
  - Splits data based on feature thresholds
  - Provides piecewise-constant predictions
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to interpret
  - Handles non-linearity and interactions well
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Can overfit if grown too deep
- **Example**: [Regression tree steps for predicting house price: first split on location, then number of rooms, then square footage, etc.]

---

## Slide 6: Overfitting & Regularization (Introduction) (~5 minutes)
- **Definition of Overfitting**:
  - Model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data
- **Common Causes**:
  - Too many features
  - Insufficient regularization
  - Complexity (e.g., very high-degree polynomial)
- **Example**: [Visual of a high-degree polynomial hugging noisy data points but missing the general trend]

---

## Slide 7: Lasso & Ridge Regularization (Deep Dive) (~10 minutes)
- **Purpose of Regularization**: Control model complexity, reduce variance
- **Ridge (L2) Regularization**:
  - Adds penalty term \( \lambda \sum \beta_i^2 \)
  - Shrinks coefficients but rarely zeroes them out
- **Lasso (L1) Regularization**:
  - Adds penalty term \( \lambda \sum |\beta_i| \)
  - Can shrink some coefficients to zero (feature selection)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - The choice of \(\lambda\) (regularization strength)
- **Example**: [Demonstrate how the same dataset can lead to different weight values with Lasso vs. Ridge]

---

## Slide 8: Evaluation Metrics (~10 minutes)
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**:
  - Measures proportion of variance explained by the model
  - Ranges from 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
  - Average of squared differences between predictions and actual values
  - Sensitive to outliers
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
  - Average of absolute differences
  - Less sensitive to outliers than MSE
- **Example**: [Compare R², MSE, and MAE on a small dataset of predicted vs. actual house prices]

---

## Slide 9: Real-World Applications (~10 minutes)
- **Industry Examples**:
  - **Finance**: Stock price or risk estimation
  - **Healthcare**: Predicting hospital readmission rates or medical costs
  - **Marketing**: Forecasting sales or customer lifetime value
  - **Engineering**: Demand prediction, quality control
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Select models based on data shape and complexity
  - Always validate with appropriate metrics
- **Example**: [Brief demonstration of using a real dataset (e.g., online advertising spend vs. sales) to build a regression model]

---

## Slide 10: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for Regression
- **Concept**
  - In regression mode, kNN predicts a value by **averaging** the target values of the \(k\) nearest neighbors in the feature space.
  - Distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean) determine which neighbors are “closest.”

- **Key Steps**
  1. Choose \(k\) (number of neighbors).
  2. Calculate distances between the new sample and all training samples.
  3. Select the \(k\) closest points.
  4. **Average** their target values to form the prediction.

---

## Slide 11: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for Regression
- **Pros**
  - Simple and intuitive.
  - Works well with non-linear relationships.
  - No explicit training phase (lazy learner).
- **Cons**
  - Can be slow for large datasets (distance calculations).
  - Performance depends heavily on choice of \(k\) and the distance metric.
  - Sensitive to feature scaling and irrelevant features.
- **Example**: [Predicting house prices based on the prices of nearest houses in the feature space (e.g., similar size, location, etc.) by taking their average price.]

---

## Slide 12: Summary & Q&A (~2 minutes)
- **Summary**:
  - Regression predicts continuous outputs
  - Linear, Polynomial, and Tree-based approaches each have pros/cons
  - Overfitting can be managed with regularization (Lasso/Ridge)
  - Evaluate models using R², MSE, and MAE
- **Final Notes**:
  - Encourage experimentation with different models
  - Stress the importance of proper validation
- **Questions?**
