  2. Recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU)
  3. Attention mechanisms & Transformers
  4. BERT, GPT, and modern NLP architectures

**Slide 2: Introduction to Word Embeddings (5-10 minutes)**
- **Concept**: Mapping words to vectors that capture semantic meaning
- **Benefits**:
  - Better representation of words
  - Reduced dimensionality of text data
- **Examples**:
  - Word similarities (e.g., "king" closer to "queen" than to "apple")
- [Example: Show a small set of vectors for words "king", "queen", "man", "woman", demonstrating distances and analogies]

---

**Slide 3: Word2Vec & GloVe (10-20 minutes)**
- **Word2Vec**:
  - Skip-gram and CBOW architectures
  - Learns vector representations by predicting neighboring words
- **GloVe**:
  - Global Vectors for word representation
  - Leverages word co-occurrence statistics across the entire corpus
- **Comparison**:
  - Word2Vec = predictive model, GloVe = count-based model
  - Both produce embeddings that can capture semantic relationships
- [Example: Display a code snippet for training a simple Word2Vec model on a small text corpus]

**Slide 4: Recurrent Neural Networks (20-35 minutes)**
- **RNN Basics**:
  - Designed for sequential data (text, time series, speech)
  - Hidden state captures past information
  - Challenges: vanishing/exploding gradients
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
  - Introduces cell state + gates to mitigate gradient issues
  - Better at capturing long-range dependencies
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**:
  - Simplified version of LSTM with fewer parameters
- [Example: Demonstrate training an LSTM on sentiment analysis with a small dataset]

---

**Slide 5: Attention Mechanisms (35-45 minutes)**
- **Motivation**:
  - RNNs struggle with long dependencies
  - Attention lets the model focus on relevant parts of the sequence
- **Key Idea**:
  - Compute a weighted sum of hidden states
  - Higher weights for more important words
- **Benefits**:
  - Improves performance in translation, summarization, etc.
- [Example: A small “toy” sequence-to-sequence model with attention visualizing attention weights]

---

**Slide 6: Transformers Architecture (45-55 minutes)**
- **Transformers**:
  - Fully based on attention (no convolutions or recurrent connections)
  - Encoder-Decoder structure
  - Self-attention mechanism
- **Advantages**:
  - Parallelizable training
  - Handles long sequences effectively
- **Key Components**:
  - Multi-head attention, positional embeddings, feed-forward layers
- [Example: Show a diagram highlighting encoder self-attention layers and how they attend to different words in a sentence]

---

**Slide 7: BERT, GPT & Modern NLP (55-65 minutes)**
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**:
  - Uses bidirectional context
  - Pre-trained on masked language modeling
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**:
  - Autoregressive model (left-to-right)
  - Strong at text generation
- **Other Architectures**:
  - T5, XLNet, ALBERT, etc.
  - Fine-tuning on downstream tasks
- [Example: Compare BERT and GPT results on completing sentences with missing words or continuing a prompt]

---

**Slide 8: Applications in NLP (65-75 minutes)**
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Classify text polarity using LSTM or Transformer-based models
- **Text Summarization**:
  - Extractive vs. abstractive summarization
  - Summarization models often use attention/Transformer-based encoders
- **Chatbots**:
  - Sequence-to-sequence + attention or Transformer-based architectures
  - Leveraging pre-trained language models for dialogue
- [Example: Use a short article to demonstrate how an abstractive summarization model (like BERT-based) condenses the text]
- [Example: Summarizing text from scratch]

---

**Slide 9: Summary & Q&A (75-80 minutes)**

  - Word embeddings capture semantic meaning
  - RNN variants address sequential dependencies
  - Attention + Transformers revolutionized NLP
  - Pre-trained models (BERT, GPT) push performance forward
- **Next Steps**:
  - Experiment with pre-trained models on real-world tasks
